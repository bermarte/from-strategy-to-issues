# Tiago's info

Hello, Iâ€™m Tiago

I write Ruby, HTML, and CSS code for [Spreds](https://spreads.com) on weekdays.

The other days, I try to share that knowledge at [Ruby Belgium](https://rubybelgium.be), [Rails Girls Brussels](https://rubybelgium.be/rails-girls/), [and Hack Your Future Belgium](https://hackyourfuture.be/).

You can reach me on [my Twitter account](https://twitter.com/otagi).
