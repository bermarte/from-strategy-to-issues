# Development Strategy

> `group 4`

write a short description of your web page:

- what is it about?
- who would want to read it?
- why would they want to read it?


An exercise we did at HYF to understand how to work with GitHubs's Project-Boards, issues and branches and pull requests together systematically. To write this Development Strategy we used the [team-branchies](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/team-branchies/blob/master/development-strategy.md) template provided by HYF. Students can study it and learn how to use it
