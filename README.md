# From-strategy-to-issues

from [HYF](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/incremental-development#week-2)   

Learn to organize your progress with issues and a project board:

0. set up your repository and clone it
1. write a development strategy
2. set up a project board on your repo
3. create one issue per step, move them to the board
4. for each step
   1. move that issue into _in progress_
   2. create a new branch locally
   3. write your new code on that branch
   4. push the branch to your repository
   5. create a PR linked to this issue
   6. move the issue to _ready for review_
   7. merge the PR, closing this step's issue
   8. move the issue into _done_
   9. pull the new `master` branch to your computer
   10. continue to the next step

**First part**
This week you will build _another_ group repository, this time learning how to use issues, labels and project boards to track your progress like in the [from-strategy-to-issues](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/from-strategy-to-issues) repository (with all steps assigned to yourself).

By break time you should each have finished to step 4.4 in the week description, you should have:

1. (GitHub) A repository with:
   1. One labeled issue per step in your development strategy
   2. One project board with a full _Ready for Review_ column
   3. Branch per step in the strategy
2. (your computer) A clone of your repository with:
   1. A development strategy ([a starter file](./development-strategies/1-individual-strategy.md))
   2. A main readme
   3. One branch per group member with an introduction file

**Second part**

Pull Requests and Merging!  In the second half of class you will practice creating and merging pull requests on GitHub, as well as linking issues to PRs and using the project boards.

For each branch on GitHub you will:

1. [create a _new_ pull request](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M16faxEQsg)
2. [link the PR to it's issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
3. Review and merge the code, [closing the linked issue](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords)
4. Move the closed issue to _done_ in your project board

By the end of class you should have a repository that resembles the [from-strategy-to-issues](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/from-strategy-to-issues) example (with all steps assigned to yourself).
